            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>A statement from the Youth</strong></p>
              <p>Over the last few days, young Nigerians all over the country have come out to peacefully protest in the thousands, demanding an end to police brutality and the disbandment of the “Special Anti Robbery Squad”. On Sunday, The 11th of October 2020 the current DG of police released a statement claiming they were disbanding/dissolving SARS as a unit.</p>
              <p>First, this is nothing new. In 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019, the same proclamations and declarations were made and nothing changed. These officials remained on the road; raping, beating, kidnapping and stealing from young Nigerians.</p>
              <p>Second, there is to be no reckoning according to the plans this administration has. All former SARS officials will be redeployed to other existing departments. That is a gross insult to the very many Nigerians who have died at the hands of these criminals. We demand a public inquiry, investigation and hearing into every death, and every act of brutality. If the police cannot hold itself to account, it does not deserve public trust and funding.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, PEACEFUL Protesters across the country have been brutalised by the police; arrested, tear gassed, sprayed with water cannons, beaten and over 10 young Nigerians have lost their lives. Our protest has both been peaceful and respectful and well within our constitutional rights.</p>
              <p>We are not criminals. We are not area boys. We are not hooligans. We are Nigerians who are FED UP and have decided we will do something about it. We inherited a broken system from you, but we want better for the generation after us.</p>
              <p>Young people know that SARS is rotten fruit of a diseased tree. We want restitution, changes in recruitment and reform. We want investigations into crimes committed by police officials.</p>
              <p>We also want a psychological evaluation & retraining (by an independent body) of all disbanded SARS officers before they are redeployed. We want an increase in police officers salaries so that they are adequately compensated for protecting lives and properties of citizens.</p>
              <p>Young Nigerians' lives are worth more than a few hours of discomfort in traffic. If you want the protests to stop, start making calls. Call your boss, your local government chairman, your state house of reps member, your federal house of reps member, your senator, your governor, your government friends and enemies. They know what to do. We will not stop till our demands are met.</p>
